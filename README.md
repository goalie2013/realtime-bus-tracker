# Realtime Bus Tracker
The Realtime Bus Tracker activity showcases using an API and a mapping service to show data in realtime. 
The project displays markers that represent current buses on their bus routes in the Greater Boston Area.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Show realtime information for other categories also in the MBTA V# API Portal,
such as trips and facilities.

## Tools used:
- Mapbox API
- MBTA V3 API Portal
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
